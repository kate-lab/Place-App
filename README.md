## Introduction

Built in a two day paired hackathon, this application lets users explore the world. This front-end React.js app pulls data from the [Road Goat API](https://developer.roadgoat.com/#introduction) using Axios requests to display up to date information about places around the world.

Built by [Iury Liberato](https://github.com/iuryliberato) and [Kate Westbrook](https://github.com/kate-lab)!

## Approach taken

As we had limited time to create the app, we decided to pair code the setup of the React app and the main components, and then worked on some individual features during the evening, including some of the CSS elements and working out some of the paths for data relationships.

We started by establishing the key features we needed as our minimum viable product:
- Destinations index grid
- Destination card to be displayed in grid
- Individual destination page
- Home page
- Navbar

We then put together our wireframes, considering how each component would be built, the functions each page would need, which data endpoints were needed, the HTML layout and how the user would navigate through the site. The red arrows are reminders of flex directions and the post-it shows the URL of the page.

## API requests

The Road Goat API is a really rich resource with a lot of information - a lot of which is generated by users and pulled from other APIs such as COVID safety data so it is really dynamic and up to date. It had two endpoints to make GET requests to - the all destinations endpoint and an individual destination by its id, which was really useful for getting a populated piece of data with more information for each destination.
We kept the site super simple so all of this information in the Road Goat database could be the star of the show!

## Project Wins

- Making a fully working app in such a short space of time
- Complicated data requests with embedded and referenced relationships
- Conditional CSS for different datasets - for example the user rating font color changes dependent on whether it is good or bad. Same for the COVID, Safety and Budget badges.
- Really getting to grips with using an external API to make requests

## Final outcome

We managed to achieve what we wanted to with this project, even in the short space of time we had. We kept it simple and were very happy with the results.
